# PokeArena #
### v0.1 ###

PokeArena is a small project that I developed to learn a bit about Python.

The game can be launched only from the terminal with:

*$: python pokearena/poke_helper.py*

Feel free to do whatever you'd like with these scripts, but be aware that all Pokemon-related copyright and trademarks are owned by Nintento/Pokemon.
